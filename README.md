# Identify-Species-of-Fish
 Classification Model to Identify Species of Fish
The Fish Catch data set contains measurements on 159 fish caught in the lake Laengelmavesi, Finland.
For the 159 fishes of 7 species the weight, length, height, and width were measured. Three different
length measurements are recorded: from the nose of the fish to the beginning of its tail, from the nose
to the notch of its tail and from the nose to the end of its tail. The height and width are calculated as
percentages of the third length variable. This results in 6 observed variables, Weight, Length1, Length2,
Length3, Height, Width. The variable, Species, represents the grouping structure: the 7 species are
1=Bream, 2=Whitewish, 3=Roach, 4=Parkki, 5=Smelt, 6=Pike, 7=Perch.
SL: Standard Length---Length1
FL: Fork Length--------Length2
TL: Total Length-------Length3
BT: Body Thickness----Height
BD: Body Depth--------Width
